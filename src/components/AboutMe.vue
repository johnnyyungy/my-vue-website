        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I have worked in the industry for almost nine years, starting in Customer Services and progressing to Design & UX.</p>
        <p>As a UI/UX Analyst, I am responsible for documenting design specifications and visually testing enhancements to ensure the delivery of intuitive, user-focused solutions.</p>
        <p>Working closely with a talented team of designers, developers, and analysts, I conduct detailed design analyses, create HTML/CSS and iOS prototypes, and produce optimized assets using tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch. I ensure design quality by performing thorough QA testing, logging issues, and collaborating with developers to resolve them. Additionally, I participate in cross-device and browser testing, document visual guidelines, and present specifications to stakeholders to maintain high standards for user interface and experience.</p>
